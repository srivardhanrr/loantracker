# ðŸ”§ Logout Function - Fixed!

## âœ… **Issue Resolved**

The logout function has been completely fixed and optimized for mobile use.

### **What was wrong:**
- The original logout view tried to display a template after logout

1. **âœ… Simplified Logout Process**: Now uses a direct POST-based logout
2. **âœ… Proper CSRF Protection**: Form includes CSRF token
3. **âœ… Mobile-Optimized**: No confirmation dialogs, smooth UX
4. **âœ… Success Messages**: User gets feedback on successful logout
5. **âœ… Immediate Redirect**: Redirects to login page instantly

1. **User clicks "Sign Out"** from the dropdown menu
2. **Form submits via POST** with CSRF protection
3. **Server logs out user** and shows success message
